# Advantages when comparing to printed newspaper debates

![](imgs/fsp_tendencias_debates.png?raw=true)

1. Printed newspapers do not effectively create a debate: there is no exchange of ideas after the arguments are published;
2. Poor possibilities for visualization of data (videos, infographics, verified sources etc.);
3. Readers opinions come (a) too late (next day edition), (b) with no highlight (squeezed and disorganized section called letters form our readers), and (c) with no continuity (next days edition raises a new debate at the spotlight);
4. Newspaper decide what themes to qual into questioning (centralization).
